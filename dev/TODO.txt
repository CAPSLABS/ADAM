- MAPCHANGE calls: story fadeout / play intro music once, then loop credit theme (D)
- buyable city hp (D)
- make people wiggle when they talk (D) (needs delta)
- texte überarbeiten für general publique 

- test balancing of spawn funcs in endless mode (P)
- latency für airhorn fixen (P)
- sfx / cooldown feedback (P)
- menu navigation via keys (P) - is there, but we need to be able to continue at the end of a level

IDEAS: 
- make lvl 2 - 5 more interesting
- animate fire
- hit feedback a la https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/eqtlz8/hitspark_tutorial_hope_it_helps_spice_up_your_game/
- mutant goblins with double update rate (or other enemy mutants)
- Final code cleanup (check all todos), maybe comment functions some more
- let the whole story be read out by voice actors
- since the format is (accidentaly) way too good for it, explore mobile port possibilities
- slowdown/acceleration when changing direction/starting to move
- pause menu for volume change
- tutorial
- if game finished, then on title screen player and lilith and pierre walk randomly instead
