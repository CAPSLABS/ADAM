- story: Check for missing points and correct spelling (P)
- rebalance: player has all silver skills after lvl 3, so fit onto that (raise prices). afterwards the player is getting one skill per level, ab lvl 7 is gut gebalanced (P)
- latency f√ºr airhorn fixen (P)
- sfx / cooldown feedback (P)

- gameplay: in lvl 8 (but not always, probably not only restricted to lvl 8) menu.lua:230, bad argument to draw (drawable expected got nil)

IDEAS: 
- make lvl 2 - 5 more interesting
- animate fire skill
- hit feedback anims a la https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/eqtlz8/hitspark_tutorial_hope_it_helps_spice_up_your_game/
- mutant goblins with double update rate (or other enemy mutants)
- let the whole story be read out by voice actors
- since the format is (accidentaly) way too good for it, explore mobile port possibilities
- slowdown/acceleration when changing direction/starting to move
- pause menu for volume change and..well, game pauses
- tutorial?
- if game finished, then on title screen player and lilith and pierre walk randomly instead
