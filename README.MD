Welcome to ADAM, the **A**wesome **D**efender **A**ction **M**urderer Game

How to install/play?

In terminal, download the source:

If you have LUA and LOVE installed skip the following steps, otherwise do:    
**ARCH:**  
`sudo pacman -S lua`  
`sudo pacman -S love`
**UBUNTU:** (needs testing)
`sudo apt install lua`  
`sudo apt install love`

then:  
`love awesomedefenderactionmurderer`


I used [TILED](https://www.mapeditor.org/) for creating the levels.
